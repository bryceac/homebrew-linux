Homebrew formulae to install custom programs on Linux.

==Note==

Many, but not all, formulae requires a later version of Swift than what Homebrew offers.

To get around this, follow instructions on the [https://swift.org/download/#using-downloads official Swift website] to install the proper toolchain.

After that, be sure to pass <strong>--env=std</strong> with the usuall installation command.
